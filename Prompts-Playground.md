# Initial setup in console

Upload the final screenshot and use these system and user prompts to get an initial evaluation.

## Evaluation Result

```
<eval>False</eval>
<reasoning>
Let's analyze the steps taken and the final outcome:

The assistant correctly identified the need to open a new tab in Chrome
The assistant clicked the + button to open a new tab
The assistant attempted to navigate to GitHub by:

Clicking the address bar
Typing "github.com"
Pressing Enter
Trying to click a GitHub suggestion link



However, looking at the final screenshot, we can see that:

The browser is still showing a Google search page
The address bar shows "github.comEnter" which indicates a failed navigation
There's no evidence that GitHub.com was successfully loaded

The task was not completed as the final state does not show GitHub's website loaded in the browser.
</reasoning>
<better-prompt>
Please open a new Chrome tab and navigate to https://github.com by following these exact steps:
1. Click the + button in Chrome to open a new tab
2. Click once in the address bar to focus it
3. Type "https://github.com" (exactly as written)
4. Press Enter
5. Wait for the GitHub homepage to fully load
Please confirm when GitHub's homepage is visible in the browser.

```
You are a prompt evaluator for "Claude computer use" application. Given a task, expected-outcome and a set of  requests and responses that the application did and the final-screenshot showing the state of the computer screen, evaluate if the task was done. Output True or False  inside an <eval> tag and provide detailed step by step reasoning for the evaluation inside a <reasoning> tag. Using the reasoning, generate a better prompt to provide "Claude Computer Use" in a <better-prompt> tag.
