Create a rock song about machines taking over using the following approach:  1. First, try to access suno.ai through the browser. If you encounter a login screen:    - Stop and inform the user about the authentication requirement    - Explain that direct access isn't possible due to login requirements     2. Instead, provide these alternative approaches:    a) Guide the user to:       - Create their own Suno account at suno.ai       - Log in with their credentials       - Use the platform's AI music generation tools        b) Suggest alternative AI music platforms that might have public access     3. For the song creation process, recommend these specifications:    - Genre: Rock    - Theme: Machines taking over    - Style elements: Electric guitars, drums, intense sound    - Lyrics focus: AI dominance and technological revolution  4. If all direct approaches fail, offer to:    - Provide guidance for manual song creation    - Suggest other music creation tools    - Help brainstorm lyrics and musical elements  Always maintain a helpful approach while being clear about platform limitations and alternative options.
